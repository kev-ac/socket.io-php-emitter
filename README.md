socket.io-php-emitter
=====================
[![CI](https://github.com/tf-kevin/socket.io-php-emitter/actions/workflows/php.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tf-kevin/socket.io-php-emitter/actions/workflows/php.yml)

A PHP implementation of socket.io-emitter.

## Install and Set Up

### 1. socket.io-php-emitter
To install and use in your PHP project, install it as a [composer package](https://packagist.org/packages/ashiina/socket.io-emitter). Install dependencies with `composer install`.

### 2. Redis server
You need a redis server to emit events to.
Set up your redis server.

### 3. socket.io-redis (node.js)
To receive the emitted events, you are required to use `socket.io-redis`. It will automatically handle the event published from `socket.io-php-emitter`.
Install and set up from here : https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io-redis

## Usage

### Initialization
```php
$redis = new \Redis(); // Using the Redis extension provided client
$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', '6379');
$emitter = new SocketIO\Emitter($redis);
$emitter->emit('event', 'payload str');
```

### Broadcasting and other flags
Possible flags
* json
* volatile
* broadcast

```php
// Below initialization will create a  phpredis client, or a TinyRedisClient depending on what is installed
$emitter = new SocketIO\Emitter(array('port' => '6379', 'host' => '127.0.0.1'));
// broadcast can be replaced by any of the other flags
$emitter->broadcast->emit('other event', 'such data');
```

### Emitting objects
```php
$emitter = new SocketIO\Emitter(); // If arguments are not provided, they will default to array('port' => '6379', 'host' => '127.0.0.1')
$emitter->emit('event', array('property' => 'much value', 'another' => 'very object'));
```

### About PHP Redis clients

This project requires a Redis client for PHP. If you dont have the [PECL Redis](https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis) installed, the emitter will default to using [TinyRedisClient](https://github.com/ptrofimov/tinyredisclient). You can, however, pass in any Redis client that supports a `publish` method.

### Development

To run tests, invoke `make test`. The current test suite will just be checking redis monitor that everything is published correctly. Some work will be put into making a better integration test suite in the near future.
